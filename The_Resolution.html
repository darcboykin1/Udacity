Well first thing is first.

I know everyone is congratulating you for finishing the WDI at GA, but as 
of right now, I know that you haven't given <i>yourself</i> a pat on the 
back. Hopefully by the time you read this you feel much more confident in 
your skills as a front end developer. If you're reading this, take a moment 
to realize how much smarter you've become over this period of time. You 
didn't know what a JavaScript was or much less, what the hell <i>React</i> 
was. I want you to be proud of yourself when you finish this course. Know 
that you've gotten through all of the ups and downs and have made it to 
here. Even if you aren't employed at the moment. Take pride in your skill, 
persistence and marketability. And keep moving forward.

And it looks like the Udacity instructors won't accept this one without you
talking about what your goals are. So, coming out of this curriculum I want to 
be able to make slick and responsive web applications. I don't just want 
something functional. I want something that <i>looks good</i> as well. That way 
the seeds will be sown and I can have a good foundational knowledge before I 
move into the wild jungle of server side development. I'd like to be able to 
take a mockup and translate that into a webpage whip-it quick. And as I mentioned
above, everything I develop should be done with mobile-first in mind. If you've 
done these things by the end of the course, consider another large leap in turning
your whole career around.
