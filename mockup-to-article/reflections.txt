I learned three (3) new html tags that I've never even heard of ! The <hr> tag should come in pretty handy for some things that I have in mind.

The difficult part of this course as I move further into the deep end will come when I have to do heavy googling for complex concepts. I can see it now.

Learning the difference between inline and block elements was a good and easy refresher.
